# Organization Profile Content

The organization profile shown at `https://github.com/geolonia` is rendered
from `profile/README.md`.

This is the **public** profile for Geolonia, so keep the content professional
and friendly. Ensure that only non-sensitive information is included here.

## Editing guidance

- Keep the intro short and friendly; it should work in both languages when possible.
- Link to high-value destinations (site, docs, blog, contact). Avoid deep links
  that change often.
- Make sure to only use emoji/formatting that renders correctly on the profile card.
