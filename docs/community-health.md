# Community Health Files

The `.github` repository applies these policies and templates to all Geolonia
repositories automatically:

- `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`: expected behavior and reporting guidance (based on
  Contributor Covenant)
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`: contribution flow, code style, and review expectations
- `SUPPORT.md`: how to request help or report issues
- `SECURITY.md`: security contacts and vulnerability reporting process
- `.github/pull_request_template.md`: prompts for summary and basic checks

## Maintenance tips

- Keep contact emails/links current in the policy files.
- When guidelines change, update this repo first so every project inherits the change.
- Avoid repository-specific information here; use project-level overrides if needed.
- Ensure no sensitive information is included, as this repo must remain public.
